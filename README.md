= Heidi2 [say it as: Heidi-Zwei]

The reincarnation of Heidi, the naive CI herder girl.

Heidi was a bit too naive (or at least the implementation) and started to
crumble when there where to many builds.

== CI herder girl?

Continious Integration, not enterprisy Travis style, but plain and simple;
*"Bauer-Art"*.

Not all things need to be tested against everything. Your thing needs to be
tested against just your setup.

== Deployment roboy?

Will be, not yet

== Status

Pre-pre-pre-alpha, at best. :wink:

== Contributing to heidi

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
